;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Install:
;; =======
;;
;; 1)
;; To obtain the feed, you must first register with weather.com[1] to obtain a license key.
;; The registration is free but mandatory.
;; Once you've registered, you'll receive a confirmation email and a link to the software developer's kit.
;; Included in the kit is a comprehensive user's guide, numerous icons, and instructions (and restrictions)
;; on use of The Weather Channel logos.
;; [1]http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html
;;
;; 2)
;; Once you have your Partner ID and License Key, you have two ways to set them up:
;;
;; A) The bad way:
;;    Add to .emacs:
;;    (setq xml-weather-login "your Partner ID")
;;    (setq xml-weather-key "your License Key")
;;
;; B) The good way:
;;    Be sure to require `auth-sources' and set it up correctly.
;;    Add to your ~/.authinfo file this line:(change login and pwd)
;;    machine xoap.weather.com port http login <Partner ID> password <License Key>
;;
;; 3) Add to .emacs (be sure xml-weather.el is in your load-path):
;;    (require 'xml-weather)
;;
;; 4) (Facultative) Get the icons set from the link to the software developer's kit
;;    you will find in your email.
;;    Put the icons in the directory of your choice and set it in your .emacs:
;;    (setq xml-weather-default-icons-directory "path/to/your/icons/31x31")
;;    NOTE: I use the 31x31 directory but you can choose bigger icons if you want.
;;          If `xml-weather-default-icons-directory' is nil or doesn't exist,
;;          your builtin will be displayed with text only.
;;
;; 5) (Facultative) Get the moon icons set:
;;    http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/xml-weather/file/66f18bcb2ed8/moon-icons2
;;    And
;;    (setq xml-weather-moon-icons-directory "Path/to/moon/icons/31X31")
;;    NOTE: If `xml-weather-moon-icons-directory' is not found, an empty image will be
;;    displayed.
;;
;; Usage:
;; =====
;; M-x xml-weather-today-at (you will have a button for forecast)
;; M-x xml-weather-forecast-at (go straight to forecast)
;; In these two functions you will have two prompt:
;; One (e.g CityName) where you enter the name of the place where you want meteo
;; and another where you will have completion for all the possible city names
;; xml-weather know.(Hit TAB ==> must match).
;; xml-weather.el provide a ticker that show a builtin for current conditions
;; all the `xml-weather-timer-delay' seconds.
;; You will have to set your current location with `xml-weather-default-id'.
;; You can fetch it with M-x xml-weather-show-id.
;; Run the ticker with M-x xml-weather-run-ticker
;; Stop timer with M-x xml-weather-ticker-cancel-timer.
